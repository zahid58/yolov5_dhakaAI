### The implementation of yolov5 is taken from https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5. 

We modified the implementations for participating in Dhaka AI Traffic Vehicle Detection Challenge 2020.

During the course of competitions, we tried Yolov3, Yolov5, Hybrid Models such as Yolov5+ResNet. We also experimented with Hierarchical models (where we group similar vehicles in one category; after detecting the general class of vehicle with one model, we used another model for more finer classification)

The repository is no longer maintained.
